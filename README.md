# fhir-kit-client-usecase-examples

These are usecase example codes for using fhir-kit-client, a FHIR JS client library to query a FHIR Server and retrieve/create Patient Demographic Information and US Core/IPS conformant resources. 

Use cases include: 

1) How to fetch patient demographics
2) How to compare demographics
3) How to find providers near patient
4) How to fetch ethnicity
5) How to fetch immunization
6) How to fetch medication
7) How to get clinical data from an IPS document for a patient
8) How to create US core lab result resource
9) How to create US core immunization
10) How to expand a valueset using a terminology server

These are codes I've written for a FHIR course for implementers.
